# Supplementary Regional Differences in Central Yiddish Vowel Length: Central Poland and the Unterland (forthcoming)

This repository contains supplementary materials for our study examining differences in vowel length across Poland and Unterland regions. These materials complement the main paper by providing detailed participant information and comprehensive statistical output.

## Repository Organization

Our materials are organized into two main sections:

### 1. Participant Information (/tables/participant_data/)
We've collected detailed demographic and linguistic information from two regions:
- Poland participant data provides information about [brief description of what's included]
- Unterland participant data includes similar information for comparison

The participant information is stored in CSV format to ensure easy access across different statistical software packages. Each data file is accompanied by a detailed codebook explaining all variables.

### 2. Statistical Analyses (/appendices/)
We provide three detailed appendices containing linear mixed effects model outputs:
- Appendix A focuses on [describe focus of first model]
- Appendix B examines [describe focus of second model]
- Appendix C analyzes [describe focus of third model]

Each appendix includes complete model specifications, diagnostics, and interpretations.

## How to Use These Materials

### Accessing Participant Data
The participant data files can be read using standard statistical software:

```R
# In R
poland_data <- read.csv("tables/participant_data/poland_participants.csv")
```

```python
# In Python
import pandas as pd
poland_data = pd.read_csv("tables/participant_data/poland_participants.csv")
```

### Understanding the Analyses
Each appendix is written in Markdown format and can be viewed directly on GitHub. They include:
- Full model specifications
- Comprehensive output tables
- Model diagnostics
- Interpretations of results

## Data Privacy and Ethics
